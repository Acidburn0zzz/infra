# infrastructure

Repo to track code + issues relating to IPFS infrastructure for users + devs.
This includes:

Computing:
- Gateway nodes
- Bootstrap nodes
- CI servers (jenkins, travis, etc)

Communications:
- Github repos
- IRC Channel
- Mailing Lists

All of these may have their own repo eventually, but for now, here.

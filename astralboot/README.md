# Astralboot

Astralboot is infrastructure written in golang that connects to ipfs.

It provides a bare metal (or virtual) install sequence from DHCP.

# Development

Current development is in https://github.com/zignig/astralboot

# Ideas

1. Serve the go builder and CI from an astralbooted machine
2. Wrap [tinycore](http://tinycorelinux.net) and ipfs together for a 30M ipfs virtual
3. Set up multi key application servers for coreos clusters from ipfs.
4. More Stuff.

# Deployment

Work towards a https://astralboot.ipfs.io/ boot from [ipxe iso](http://ipxe.org/).
